****Project Title:** CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using Neural Networks**

Overview
This project involves using the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a neural network for image
classification. It's designed to teach fundamental concepts in deep learning like data handling,
model design, and model evaluation.

Objectives
• Learn data preprocessing techniques and neural network construction.
• Understand model compilation and training.
• Evaluate model performance and analyze training outcomes.

Tools and Libraries
• Python
• Keras
• Matplotlib
• Numpy

**Project Outline**
1. Introduction to CIFAR-10 Dataset 
• Load and describe the dataset.
• Explain the significance of using CIFAR-10 for learning image classification.
2. Data Preprocessing
• Visualize and display images from the dataset.
• Normalize the image pixel values.
• Reshape and flatten the data if necessary.
• Convert class vectors to binary class matrices (one-hot encoding).
3. Building the Neural Network 
• Construct a neural network using the Sequential model.
• Add appropriate layers (Dense, Activation, Flatten) with explanations for choices.
• Explain the choice of activation function, particularly softmax for the output
layer.
4. Compiling the Model 
• Set the loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
• Discuss the chosen configurations and their impact on training.
5. Training the Model 
• Train the model with defined epochs and batch size.
• Implement and justify the use of a validation split.
• Provide detailed observations from the training output.
6. Evaluating the Model 
• Evaluate the model using the test dataset.
• Report and interpret the test loss and accuracy.
7. Visualization of Training Progress (10 Points)
• Plot training and validation accuracy and loss.
• Analyze and discuss what these metrics suggest about the model’s performance
over time.
8. Making Predictions
• Use the model to make predictions on new data.
• Visualize and discuss the accuracy of predictions versus actual labels.
9. Conclusion
• Summarize key learnings.
• Discuss potential improvements and real-world applicability of the model.
